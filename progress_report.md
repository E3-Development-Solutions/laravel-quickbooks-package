# Laravel QuickBooks Package - Implementation Progress Report

## Overview
This report outlines the progress made on the Laravel QuickBooks package with Filament integration. The package is being developed according to the requirements specified in the project plan and subsequent clarifications.

## Completed Tasks

### Requirements Gathering
- Reviewed the project plan document
- Clarified requirements with the user
- Confirmed vendor name: E3-Development-Solutions
- Confirmed QuickBooks entities: Customer, Invoice, Item, Purchase Order, and Sales Order
- Confirmed user model integration approach: Both trait and inheritance
- Confirmed Filament version: v3

### Architecture Design
- Created comprehensive directory structure
- Designed service provider architecture
- Planned authentication flow using OAuth2
- Designed entity models and services
- Planned Filament integration for all entities

### Implementation (Core Components)
- Initialized package repository
- Set up composer.json with required dependencies
- Implemented QuickBooksServiceProvider
- Created QuickBooks Facade
- Implemented configuration file
- Created migration for QuickBooks user fields
- Implemented QuickBooksBaseService with authentication
- Created exception classes
- Implemented HasQuickBooksAuthentication trait
- Set up routes for authentication
- Implemented QuickBooksAuthController
- Created QuickBooksAuthenticated middleware

## Current Status
The foundational components of the package have been implemented. This includes:

1. **Package Structure**: Directory structure following Laravel package best practices
2. **Authentication**: OAuth2 flow with token storage and refresh logic
3. **User Integration**: Trait for easy integration with existing user models
4. **Configuration**: Comprehensive configuration file with environment variables
5. **Service Provider**: Registration of services, routes, and configuration

## Next Steps

1. **Entity Services**: Implement services for Customer, Invoice, Item, Purchase Order, and Sales Order
2. **Filament Resources**: Create Filament resources for all entities
3. **Testing**: Set up testing environment and write unit tests
4. **Documentation**: Create comprehensive documentation for installation and usage

## Technical Details

### Package Information
- **Namespace**: E3DevelopmentSolutions\QuickBooks
- **Composer Package**: e3-development-solutions/quickbooks
- **Laravel Version**: 10.x, 11.x, 12.x
- **Filament Version**: 3.x
- **QuickBooks SDK**: intuit/quickbooks-php-sdk v3

### Authentication Flow
The package implements OAuth2 authentication with QuickBooks Online:
1. User initiates connection via `/quickbooks/connect` route
2. User authenticates with QuickBooks and grants permissions
3. QuickBooks redirects to callback URL with authorization code
4. Package exchanges code for access and refresh tokens
5. Tokens are stored in the user model
6. Tokens are automatically refreshed when expired

### User Model Integration
The package provides two methods for integrating with user models:
1. **Trait**: `HasQuickBooksAuthentication` trait can be added to existing user models
2. **Inheritance**: Abstract user class will be provided for inheritance-based integration

## Conclusion
The core foundation of the Laravel QuickBooks package has been successfully implemented. The next phase will focus on implementing entity-specific services and Filament resources for CRUD operations.
